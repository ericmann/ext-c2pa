//! Build script for `ext-c2pa`.
//!
//! Single job today: emit the `cdylib` link flags needed to defer Zend
//! symbols (`zend_throw_exception`, `zval_ptr_dtor`, `spl_ce_RuntimeException`,
//! ...) to runtime resolution against the host PHP binary.
//!
//! `.cargo/config.toml` carries the same flags, but its `rustflags` array
//! is silently replaced when a `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable is set
//! (cargo precedence: env var > config). Our CI sets `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`
//! globally, which would clobber the link flag and break the macOS build
//! at link time with "Undefined symbols: _spl_ce_RuntimeException, ...".
//!
//! `cargo:rustc-cdylib-link-arg=` is a *separate* mechanism that always
//! applies — it doesn't go through `rustflags` — so emitting from build.rs
//! is robust regardless of how the consumer's environment is configured.
